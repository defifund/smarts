# Base class for all MCP tools, on top of the official `mcp` gem
# (modelcontextprotocol/ruby-sdk).
#
# Subclasses define their business logic in `self.payload(**args)`,
# returning a plain Ruby Hash. The base class's `self.call` wraps that
# hash in the `MCP::Tool::Response` shape required by the SDK,
# JSON-encoding the payload as a single text content block — that's how
# MCP clients (Claude, Cursor, …) feed structured tool output back to
# the LLM.
#
# Splitting `payload` from `call` keeps the SDK plumbing in one place
# and lets tests assert against the underlying Hash directly without
# unwrapping protocol envelopes.
