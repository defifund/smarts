# Friendly slug ↔ (chain, address) mapping for curated blue-chip contracts.
#
# Shape: `{symbol}-{chain}` (e.g. `uni-eth`, `usdc-base`). Only whitelisted
# entries have slugs — everything else addresses via hex at `/:chain/:address`.
# Slug is the canonical form; hex URLs 301 to the slug when one exists.
#
# Aliases: when a token rebrands on-chain (e.g. Polygon MATIC → POL in 2024),
# the new slug is added AFTER the old one. Both slugs continue to resolve
# (so existing links don't break), but REVERSE is built with last-write-wins
# so the canonical slug used in breadcrumbs, MCP cards, and hex → slug
# redirects is the *newest* one. Pages served from the legacy slug still
# emit `<link rel="canonical">` pointing at the new one, so Google converges
# on the current brand without a 301 hop.
