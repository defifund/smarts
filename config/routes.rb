  # MCP server (Streamable HTTP transport, MCP spec 2025-03-26).
  #
  # `MCP::Server::Transports::StreamableHTTPTransport` is a standard Rack
  # app that internally dispatches POST (client-to-server JSON-RPC),
  # GET (optional server-to-client SSE stream), and DELETE (session
  # termination) per the spec. Mounting at `/mcp` routes all those.
  #
  # `stateless: true` skips per-session memory state, which lets us run
  # Puma with workers > 0 and scale horizontally without sticky sessions.
  # We have no notification / progress / subscription needs — every tool
  # call is request/response — so statelessness is the right default.
  #
  # Tool classes are eagerly referenced here so Zeitwerk autoloads them
  # when routes are drawn; constructor takes the array directly.
